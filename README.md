# django-mastodon-comments

David Revoy describes how he started using replies to a Mastodon post as the comment engine for his blog posts. His blog post describing his solution is at https://www.davidrevoy.com/article981/i-may-have-found-an-alternative-solution-to-my-blogs-comment-system. I think a Django app that does the same thing might be quite nice.
